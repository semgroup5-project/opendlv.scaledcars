CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:66 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindOpenDaVINCI.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "OpenDaVINCI", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "OpenDaVINCI" with
  any of the following names:

    OpenDaVINCIConfig.cmake
    opendavinci-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "OpenDaVINCI" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "OpenDaVINCI_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "OpenDaVINCI" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
